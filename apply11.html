		<p>If you do not have a credit history yet, building a good credit should not be as hard as you may think.  
			Latoya Irby’s online article discussed the process in simple terms, and it is mostly about living within 
			your means, making good judgements about your credit card purchases and being diligent about paying your 
			bills.  Do not be in a rush to build your credit history by having multiple credit cards – one should 
			suffice to start with and when you are in a better place financially and have a good handle on your 
			finances, then and only then should you consider applying for another one.  In any case, you want to hang 
			on to your credit card account for as long as possible so that you can have a solid (and hopefully good) 
			credit history.  Irby, in her article, gave seven pointers that should help you build a good credit, and 
			they are listed below.  To view Irby’s article, click

		<ul>
			<li>Only borrow what you can afford</li>
			<li>Use only a small amount of the credit you have available</li>
			<li>Start with only one credit card</li>
			<li>Pay your credit card balance in full</li>
			<li>Make all your payments on time</li>
			<li>If you carry a balance, do it the right way</li>
			<li>Let your accounts age</li>
